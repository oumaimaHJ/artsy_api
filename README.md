# artsy_api
You are given artist IDs in the Artsy database (in the id.txt file). For each ID, get information about the artist's name and year of birth. 
Print the names of the artists in non-decreasing order of the year of birth. If the artists have the same year of birth, print their names in lexicographical order.
